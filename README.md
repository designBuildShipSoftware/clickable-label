Use label tag

Tip: A label can be bound to an element either by using the "for" attribute, or by placing the element inside the <label> element.

A blind user might want to hear all of the labels. With "for" attribute of the label tag, he/she might be able to get the point of the radio button or checkbox or input text area in less than 0.1 second.
